                The company is really not that strict during our break time. We can sleep, eat, play games, or even sing and
                dance during our break, but during my break I usually do stuff related to programming or something to improve 
                my analytical skills and problem solving skills, like watching youtube lessons which is what I'm doing in the photo, 
                or playing chess, or solving coding challenges in CSS battle or leetcode.

                I personally prefer watching YouTube videos over reading books or taking online courses since I learn 
                better visually. I took advantage of this opportunity to brush up on my knowledge of HTML & CSS by watching 
                YouTube lessons during my breaks or when there are no immediate tasks to complete because my role and 
                responsibilities revolve around front-end development.
