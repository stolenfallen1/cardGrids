                I was tasked to develop my own custom hook with a purpose and deploy it to npm package manager, The custom hook I decided
                to create was really not that unique in terms of idea since a lot of brilliant ideas are already out there are creating one 
                takes a lot of time and intellegence which I think i still lack of at the moment. You can check out the custom hook I made
                here: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/caesar-hooks">https://www.npmjs.com/package/caesar-hooks</a>

                I say this because of how great react is, It does not just promote reusable, clean and lesser code in developing UI 
                but also provides a virtual DOM that optimizes the rendering process, resulting in faster and more 
                efficient updates to the UI. Additionally, React's component-based architecture makes it easy to build complex 
                user interfaces by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces, which can be reused across multiple 
                projects, saving developers valuable time and effort. Whether building a simple website or a complex web 
                application, React is a fantastic choice that can help us create high-quality, performant, and scalable user 
                interfaces that users will surely love.
