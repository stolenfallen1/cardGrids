                Being an aspiring developer is not easy! We all know that, and to improve our development
                skills we need to keep learning new things through exploration, and self studying is one means of doing so, and
                the company even gives us time to study on our own and suggests free internet resources for interns.

                The company is really not that strict during our break time. We can sleep, eat, play games, or even sing and
                dance during our break, but during my break I usually do stuff related to programming or something to improve 
                my analytical skills and problem solving skills, like watching youtube lessons which is what I'm doing in the photo, 
                or playing chess, or solving coding challenges in CSS battle or leetcode.

                At 11 a.m., the interns all gather for lunch, but we don't just eat the delectable food that brader, the 
                company chef as the other employees refer to him prepares. We usually talk about our problems and the difficult 
                tasks we have been given at this time. Sometimes we even gossip about someone outside the organization 
                or discuss news pertaining to anime and k-drama.

                I never imagined how challenging it would be to work as a front-end developer. It's absurd how many technological 
                frameworks and tools you need to learn and practice with in order to create a better user interface. The desire 
                for better user interfaces has grown dramatically over time. As improved UIs encourage an improved user experience.

                Delicious food is arguably the closest thing to heaven, and receiving free good food is nirvana. The 
                free meal was one of the nicest bonuses the company could offer, and the interns and I really enjoyed it, especially 
                my USPF classmate and batchmate Karl we call him master kaloyskiii the King of mukbang, the bola-bola lover.

                I was tasked to develop my own custom hook with a purpose and deploy it to npm package manager, The custom hook I decided
                to create was really not that unique in terms of idea since a lot of brilliant ideas are already out there are creating one 
                takes a lot of time and intellegence which I think i still lack of at the moment. You can check out the custom hook I made

                As a UI developer intern, I was assigned to develop a mobile application for a project. At first, I felt overwhelmed 
                since I had no prior experience with mobile development. However, because I had already been trained in React JS, 
                I quickly realized that React Native was essentially React for mobile development. This made it much easier for me 
                to understand and explore, and I was ultimately able to execute the tasks properly.

                Without fail, every morning at 9 A.M., the company's trusted vendors make their way to our doors, offering a 
                mouthwatering selection of street food delicacies such as qwek-qwek, fishballs, and tempura. Interestingly, the 
                company has a laid-back attitude towards interns when it comes to taking breaks. Nevertheless, I have come to 
                realize the importance of utilizing my time wisely during my 15 min respite. Apart from indulging in a quick bite, 
                I make it a point to converse with my colleagues, seek assistance on challenging tasks, and clarify any uncertainties 
                I may have.
